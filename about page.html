	<h1>How to play the game!</h1>


	<p>Just like any other noughts & crossses game, two players will need to compete
	with each other to get three in a row whether if you're an "X" or "O".</p>


	<p>Whenever it is player 1's (X) turn, the player 1 button on the left pane will change to the colour green. The same goes for the player 2 (O) button on the right pane. </p>


	<p>The winner will be declared when a pop up message appears stating who has won the game.</p>
